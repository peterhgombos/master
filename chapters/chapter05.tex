\chapter{Discussion}
\label{ch:chapter5}

Problems with some hardware platforms - bad documentation.

Had to edit data, because logging over noon or midnight provided bugs. 24-hour clocks are best!

Energy difference measured.

What does the speed do? Would just optimizing for speed hold up?
What is the size requirement of io.js?

\section{Espruino slow}
As Espruino executes source code directly


Shift, tessel - why does it run so slow? Lua translation.

What amount of the measured power draw is from the platform. What also draws power? (wifi tessel, network raspberry pi)

Variance?
